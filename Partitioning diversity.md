# Partitioning diversity following Laliberté et al. 2020 Ecol lett

As outlined by Laliberté et al. 2020 for the case of spectral diversity, it can be useful/insightful to partition components of diversity ($\gamma, \beta \text{ and } \alpha$) when rows in the dataset can be ascribed to discrete groups. This way,
