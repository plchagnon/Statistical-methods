# Interval-PLS in R

Interval partial least squares (iPLS) was originally proposed by [Norgaard et al.](https://doi.org/10.1366/0003702001949500). In their paper, Norgaard et al. expose clearly the trade-offs faced in chemometric applications utilizing spectral data. This applies, however, to any other high-dimensionality dataset with neighbouring explanatory variables being non-indepedant (e.g., temporal fine-scale data on a given parameter $x$ such as soil moisture). The trade-offs faced in such cases is one between (1) reducing data complexity to a limited, manageable number of features of interest, and (2) biological/chemical interpretability. Traditional methods to reduce data dimensionality are principal component analysis (PCA) or the use of latent variables in traditional PLS. 

Others to do:

1. Regular PLS
2. Cubist
3. Support vector machine reg
4. Random forest
5. Cokriging
6. Multicollocated cokriging
7. Variogram
