OK, not a statistical method, but useful to communicate paper-associated codes and pipelines in view of publishing something that looks professional! Using the VS Code extension ``markdown-pdf``, we can customize the format using two key files, namely a ``.css`` file that contains information about the format desired regarding background, font sizes, color, etc.etc.etc, and another ``.json`` file providing more general information regarding the extension parameters (among other things).

Of course, regarding the ``.json`` file, the exact path specified to find the ``.css`` file will depend on your own folder structure. In my case, I have put it in the markdown-pdf's folder where the built-in ``.css`` files are located. I just felt it was handy this way...
